 * Removed non-used debugging statements
 * <bug fix> Stairs now face the correct direction when placed!
-------10a-------
 * Removed more unused debugging statements
 * Did some work on tileentity classes
 * Started fixing block placeholder texture
 * <new info> May be creating a new block incorrectly - use instance in ModBlocks opposed to new block
-------10b-------
 * BridgeBuilder now works up and down
 * Removed commented-out methods
 * Made some edits to the handling of the placeholder texture
 * <bug fix?> Block is no longer placed as null, I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it...
 * NOTE: Look at ClientProxy from the TutorialMod (block instanceof BlockTileEntity)
 * <game crash> After later edits, game crashed first startup after edit
-------10c-------
 * <bug fix> Pillars are no longer built - entity now moves before calculating its direction
 * <bug fix> Staircase should be build at a 45 degree angle if entity is fired at a larger angle
 * <bug fix> Tileentities connected to blocks are now properly registered and able to save to NBT
-------10d-------
 * <info> Changed pack_format in pack.mcmeta to 2, will see if it works when building
-------10e-------

 * <bug fix> reordered code, direction is now calculated at a better time
 * BUILD: Created build 0.1.4.10e to test pack.mcmeta stuff
-------10f-------
 * <bug fix> Renamed everything because Minecraft hates camel case for some reason
