-------10a-------
 * Removed more unused debugging statements
 * Did some work on tileentity classes
 * Started fixing block placeholder texture
 * <new info> May be creating a new block incorrectly - use instance in ModBlocks opposed to new block
-------10b-------
 * BridgeBuilder now works up and down
 * Removed commented-out methods
 * Made some edits to the handling of the placeholder texture
 * <bug fix?> Block is no longer placed as null, I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it...
 * NOTE: Look at ClientProxy from the TutorialMod (block instanceof BlockTileEntity)
 * <game crash> After later edits, game crashed first startup after edit
