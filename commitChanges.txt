* Created ItemFlare
* Added a placeholder system that allows for items to use a generic texture (allows me to simply replace name afterwards)
* Deleted commented code that is not likely to be used again
* Changed specific class ItemFlareGun to generic class ItemEntityGun
* Added EntityBridgeCreator to ModEntities
* Decided that I should probably commit more often
